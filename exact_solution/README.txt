The Traveling Salesperson Problem is important because it helps with finding the most efficient way of covering multiple verticies 
which is very important when trying to minimise cost and save time. An example of TSP being used would be an automated warehouse where 
robots can use TSP to find the shortest path to pick up or deliver an item. Furthermore, another application of TSP would be
a tour guide using TSP to plan a tour that minimizes the travel time or cost of travel.
