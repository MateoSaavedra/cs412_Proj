# input
g = (v, e)
certificate = (cycle, cost)
k = maximum cost

# Output
True if the certificate is valid, False otherwise

# check if the cycle is valid
    1) Verify that the cycle has all vertices in V exactly once
    2) Verify that it forms a cycle 
    3) Verify that each edge in answer exists

# Calculate the total cost
    1) total_cost = 0
    2) for each edge (u, v) in the cycle:
            Add the weight of the edge (u, v) to total_cost

# Compare total_cost <= k, return true

# Retrun false if not
